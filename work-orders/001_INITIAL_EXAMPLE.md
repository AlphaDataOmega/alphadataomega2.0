## FEATURE:

- Modern Next.js 14+ web application with TypeScript
- Task management dashboard with real-time updates
- User authentication with NextAuth.js
- API routes for CRUD operations
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Database integration with Prisma ORM
- Visual testing integration for UI validation

## EXAMPLES:

In the `examples/` folder, there is a README for you to read to understand what the example is all about and also how to structure your own README when you create documentation for the above feature.

- `examples/nextjs/` - Next.js project structure and best practices
- `examples/components/` - Reusable React components with TypeScript
- `examples/api/` - API route patterns and database operations
- `examples/auth/` - Authentication setup and middleware patterns
- `examples/testing/` - Testing patterns for React components and API routes

Don't copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.

## DOCUMENTATION:
