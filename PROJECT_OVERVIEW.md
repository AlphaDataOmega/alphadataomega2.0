# AlphaDataOmega Project Overview: Introduction & Strategic Vision

## Executive Summary

AlphaDataOmega (ADO) is a sovereign blockchain lattice implementing a comprehensive four-project parallel development strategy to create AI-data harmony through decentralized content economy. The ecosystem features TRN (ThisRightNow) as the flagship Layer-3 content platform, enabling creators to monetize content while maintaining absolute data sovereignty through bounded AI agents and immutable storage infrastructure.

- **Economic Attack Simulation:** CadCAD-based economic exploit modeling

**Phase 3: Production Hardening (Weeks 17-24)**
- **Bug Bounty Program:** $75k structured rewards program
  - Critical vulnerabilities: $10k per finding
  - High severity: $5k per finding  
  - Medium severity: $1k per finding

Possibly an initial audit in Phase 1 for core contracts, then another after any major changes or additions (like before enabling real funds). The "Dev Docs" imply a high degree of clarity which auditors will appreciate.

**Open Bug Bounties:** In addition to paid audits, they will run a bug bounty program to leverage community white-hat hackers. Platforms like Immunefi could be used, with bounties tiered by severity. For example, a critical flaw (steal funds, halt oracle) might have a bounty of $50k or $100k. Lesser issues smaller rewards. This encourages continuous scrutiny even after launch. They might allocate, say, $100k initially for bounties and potentially more over time. If InvestorNFTs generate revenue, some could be earmarked to fund ongoing security incentives.

**DAO Security Fund:** Possibly the DAO will maintain a reserve specifically for emergency patches and bounties. This could come from the treasury (the DAO gets 10% of platform earnings, a fraction could be dedicated to security expenses).

**Internal Code Reviews:** Beyond external audits, the dev team will do extensive internal peer review and perhaps formal verification on critical pieces (like the TRNâBRN peg logic might be formally verified for invariants).

**Budget Consideration:** They will ensure audit/bounty costs are included in funding. If budget is tight, they might prioritize audits on the most critical contracts first (like vault and oracle) and do bounties for the rest. However, given the ambition, likely they raised or allocated enough to do it properly. If needed, they might delay launch to not launch unaudited code â that's how crucial it is.

**Naming specific firms:** PeckShield was mentioned as an example; they are indeed known for catching many issues. OpenZeppelin could also be likely since they offer audit services and have experience with Governor and ERC stuff. A multi-firm approach is ideal to catch different classes of bugs. In summary, expect a two-pronged approach: external audits by top firms (with a healthy budget because this is complex code) and an ongoing bug bounty program for community to report issues. This ensures both pre-launch and post-launch security coverage.
