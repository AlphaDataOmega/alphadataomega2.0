# AlphaDataOmega (ADO) & TRN Platform â€“ Project Overview Part 10

## Moderation & Geolocation Systems

### Content Moderation Architecture

#### Bless/Burn Mechanism with Economic Incentives

The TRN platform implements a sophisticated content moderation system that combines community governance with AI-powered analysis through the Bless/Burn mechanism:

**Core Economic Structure:**
- **1 TRN Cost Per Action:** Each burn or bless action costs exactly 1 TRN to prevent spam campaigns and ensure meaningful community participation
- **15% Burn Threshold:** Content reaching 15% burn ratio gets soft suppressed (hidden from feeds but remains accessible via direct link)
- **25% Burn Threshold:** Content automatically flagged for DAO review and potential permanent removal
- **Temporal Vote Decay:** Vote weights decrease over time to prevent historical pile-ons and reflect evolving community standards

**Multi-Layer Threshold System:**

1. **Absolute Burn Count (Z = 10):** Hard threshold where 10 burns from distinct users triggers escalation regardless of total engagement
2. **User Flag Threshold (X = 5):** Independent flagging system allowing users to report content without spending TRN
3. **AI Severity Override (Y = 9/10):** SemanticTrustOracle can instantly escalate illegal or severely harmful content
4. **Composite Scoring:** Weighted combination considering burn ratio, absolute counts, and AI confidence scores

**Revenue Distribution Impact:**
- **Standard Content:** 90% creator, 10% DAO
- **Flagged Content:** Revenue temporarily escrowed pending review
- **Burn Token Mechanics:** $BRN (Burn Reserve Notes) used internally for moderation economics - users never hold these tokens directly

#### SemanticTrustOracle: AI-Powered Content Analysis

- **Threshold System:** 700 suspicion score = flag, 900 = auto-ban with <5% false positive rate
- **Device Diversity:** <3 device diversity triggers suspicious behavior alerts
- **Adversarial Protection:** Quarterly adversarial training updates and robust model architecture

### Geolocation & Cross-Border Compliance System

#### Multi-Layer Geographic Enforcement Framework
