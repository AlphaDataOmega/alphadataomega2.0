# AlphaDataOmega Project Overview: User Sovereignty & Security Architecture

## 8-Shard Sovereignty System

### Core Security Framework

AlphaDataOmega implements a revolutionary 8-shard security system that provides unprecedented user sovereignty while maintaining enterprise-grade security through distributed key management.

**Architecture Overview:**
- **7 User-Controlled Shards:** Distributed across different storage methods and devices
- **Hidden 8th Shard:** Emergency recovery via BLS multi-signature from MasterNFT/Council
- **5-of-7 Threshold:** Users maintain full control with multiple redundancy options
- **Quantum-Resistant Foundation:** GF(2^256) field operations with post-quantum migration path

### Shard Distribution Strategy

**Recommended Shard Allocation:**
1. **Mobile Device Shard:** Biometric-secured on primary smartphone
2. **Desktop/Laptop Shard:** Hardware wallet or secure enclave storage
3. **Cloud Backup Shard:** Encrypted backup in user-chosen cloud service
4. **Physical Backup Shard:** Hardware device (USB, paper wallet) in secure location
5. **Trusted Contact Shard:** Family member or close friend custody
6. **Geographic Backup Shard:** Different location (work, safety deposit box)
7. **Biometric Shard:** Backup biometric authentication method

**Hidden 8th Shard:**
- Controlled by BLS multi-signature from MasterNFT holders and elected Council
- Only accessible through DAO governance vote for extraordinary circumstances
- Requires post-action ratification by community governance
- Provides ultimate safety net while preserving decentralization principles

### Recovery Mechanisms

**Standard Recovery (5-of-7 Shards Available):**
- User initiates recovery process through any accessible shard
- Smart contract validates shard authenticity using Shamir Secret Sharing
- Automatic reconstruction of master key within secure enclave
- All existing shards remain valid; compromised shards can be rotated

**Emergency Recovery (Less than 5 Shards):**
- Requires demonstration of extraordinary circumstances to DAO
- Identity verification through multiple sources (social, biometric, historical)
- Community vote with 2/3 majority required for 8th shard activation
- 7-day delay period allowing objections and additional verification
- New shard set generated; all previous shards invalidated

**Recovery Best Practices:**
- Regular shard accessibility testing (monthly recommended)
- Geographic distribution across multiple jurisdictions
- Diverse storage methods to prevent correlated failures
- Regular backup verification and secure rotation procedures
