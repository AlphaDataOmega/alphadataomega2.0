# AlphaDataOmega Context & Assumptions

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-12

## Project Summary
AlphaDataOmega (ADO) is a sovereign blockchain lattice that creates AI-data harmony through decentralized content economy. The system features TRN as the flagship platform enabling creators to monetize content while maintaining data sovereignty through bounded AI agents and immutable storage.

## The Why Behind the Project
Current centralized AI systems create data sovereignty erosion where users lose control over their data and value flows inefficiently. ADO solves this through an immutable, interconnected lattice where users retain absolute control while AI agents operate within bounded parameters, preventing emergence risks and ensuring transparent value distribution.

## The How Behind the Project
Hybrid architecture combining OP Stack L2 for fast settlements, IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage, bounded AI agents with local Llama models, and economic incentives through TRN token pegged to real storage costs ($0.065 based on IPFS+CDN infrastructure). Multi-signature security with 5-of-7 shard authentication ensures robust governance.

## The What Behind the Project
- Sovereign blockchain lattice with TRN content economy platform
- Economic tokens: ADO (governance, free-floating), TRN (content economy at $0.065 USD peg)
- Smart contracts: MintThrottleController (15.4M TRN/day), PegMechanism (¬±2% tolerance)
- Multi-signature security with NFT-based role management
- Bounded AI agents preventing emergence risks with semantic search
- Decentralized storage integration (IPFS/Arweave) for eternal data preservation
