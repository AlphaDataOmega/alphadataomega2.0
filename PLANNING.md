**Last Updated:** 2025-07-12  
**Status:** Initial Planning Phase

## Project Overview
AlphaDataOmega (ADO) is a sovereign blockchain lattice ecosystem consisting of multiple interconnected projects:

### 🔗 **The Chain (OP Stack L2)**
Custom OP Stack L2 blockchain providing the foundational infrastructure for the entire ecosystem with post-quantum security and ZK compliance features.

### 🏭 **DAO Generator**
Template-based system for creating organization-specific L3 chains with automated DAO deployment, governance frameworks, and economic models.

### 🏛️ **Two Core DAOs**
1. **AlphaDataOmega DAO**: Main governance body controlling the L2 chain, economic parameters, and ecosystem development
2. **TRN DAO**: Content platform governance managing creator economy, moderation policies, and revenue distribution

### 📱 **TRN DApp**
