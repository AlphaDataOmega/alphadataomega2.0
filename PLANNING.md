# AlphaDataOmega - Project Planning

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-12  
**Status:** Initial Planning Phase

## Project Overview
AlphaDataOmega (ADO) is a sovereign blockchain lattice ecosystem consisting of multiple interconnected projects:

### 🔗 **The Chain (OP Stack L2)**
Custom OP Stack L2 blockchain providing the foundational infrastructure for the entire ecosystem with post-quantum security and ZK compliance features.

### 🏭 **DAO Generator**
Template-based system for creating organization-specific L3 chains with automated DAO deployment, governance frameworks, and economic models.

### 🏛️ **Two Core DAOs**
1. **AlphaDataOmega DAO**: Main governance body controlling the L2 chain, economic parameters, and ecosystem development
2. **TRN DAO**: Content platform governance managing creator economy, moderation policies, and revenue distribution

### 📱 **TRN DApp**
Flagship decentralized content platform with circular dial interface, real-time streaming, and sovereign creator monetization built on the ADO L2 chain.

- React prototype of circular dial interface with Tailwind CSS components
- Comprehensive test framework (Foundry + Pytest, 90%+ coverage) with automated CI/CD

#### **Daily Workflow**
- **Morning Sync (30min):** Review previous day, plan parallel tracks
- **Parallel Execution (6-8hrs):** Independent work on separate domains
- **Evening Integration (1hr):** Merge work, test integration, next day planning

#### **Validation Gates**
